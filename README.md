Hand Landmarks Detection with OpenCV and Mediapipe
This mini project demonstrates hand landmarks detection using OpenCV and the Mediapipe library. The program captures video frames from the default webcam, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and displays the frames with hand landmarks and the calculated frames per second (FPS).

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Mediapipe
